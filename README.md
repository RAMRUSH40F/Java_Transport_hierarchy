### Transport_hierarchy project

It is made in order to gain some experience in making APIs(Interface) and —Ålass hierarchy.

Classes: <br>
Abstractions.Machine -> surface transport -> wheeled transport / railway transport
->  public transport.<br>
Abstractions.Machine -> water transport -> <br>
Abstractions.Machine -> aircraft ->
---

Plans:
Abstractions:

+ steam engine interface(steam-train, steamship)
+ electric engine interface ( tesla, elctrobus )
+ military technics interface

Nearest Future:
Surface transport-> public transport interface(like cruiseship) -- done

military_interface ( shoot, destroy, reload)  -- done

Adding JUnit test --done(+fixed some bugs) --done

Military airccraft and a tank, which can damage 1. each other 2.transport --
