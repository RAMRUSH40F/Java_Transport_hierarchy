### Transport_hierarchy project
It is made in order to gain some experience in making APIs(Interface) and —Ålass hierarchy.

Classes: <br>
Machine -> surface transport -> wheeled transport / railway transport
         ->  public transport.<br>
Machine -> water transport -> <br>
Machine -> aircraft ->
---
Interfaces:
+ steam engine interface(steam-train, steamship) 
+ electric engine interface ( tesla, elctrobus ) 
+ military technics interface 

Nearest Future:
water transport -> aircraft carrier (has airctaft in it)

Surface transport-> public transport interface(like cruiseship)


machine -> aircraft
machine -> tank

military_interface ( shoot, destroy, reload)
